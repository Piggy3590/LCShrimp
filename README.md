This mod adds a bizarre, weird, and maybe even cute new indoor creature: the Shrimp from *The Upturned*.

It hasn't been properly tested yet and may contain bugs that interfere with gameplay!

Shrimp was originally integrated into [LC_Office](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Piggy/LC_Office/), but was recently separated due to issues including bugs.

# Credits

Models and rigs are from [The Upturned](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1717770/The_Upturned/) by Zeekerrs, which I will remove if it becomes an issue.

Zeekerss' [The Upturned](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1717770/The_Upturned/) is really cool game, Give it a try!
